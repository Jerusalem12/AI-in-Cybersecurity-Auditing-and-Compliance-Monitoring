Fine-tune using binary cross-entropy loss with batch size 32, learning rate 1.5e-5, for 2\u20133 epochs.\n3. Track dev metrics such as AUC and MAP to monitor overfitting.\n4. Collect dev logits/probabilities and fit an isotonic or Platt calibrator (dev only).\n5. Save the calibrated model and visualize reliability (ECE or curve) for reporting."
